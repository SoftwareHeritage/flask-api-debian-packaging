Comment: the Debian orig tarball has been repackaged from upstream tarball.
 In particular, minified JavaScript and CSS files that were distributed by
 upstream in minified form only have been removed. Left-over *.pyc Python
 bytecode files have been stripped too. See get-orig-source debian/rules target
 for details about the repackaging process.
